MZR Survey - URL Update Log
==========================

Date: 2025-08-13
Task: Update GitHub repository URLs from old to new location

Changes Made:
============

1. Updated BottomActionBar.tsx (src/components/BottomActionBar.tsx)
   - Line 66: Changed GitHub URL from:
     "https://github.com/zain-riaz-dev/mzr-survey"
     to:
     "https://github.com/zainriaz-dev/mzr-surveys"

Impact:
=======
- This change affects the footer component that appears on:
  * Main page (localhost:3000/)
  * Survey page (localhost:3000/survey)
- Users clicking the "GitHub Repo" button in the open-source dropdown will now be directed to the correct repository

Files NOT Changed:
==================
- README.md: Contains documentation and setup instructions with the correct m-z-r URLs
- Other configuration files: Already pointing to correct URLs

Notes:
======
- Only updated the user-facing GitHub link in the footer component as specifically requested
- README.md and other documentation already had the correct m-z-r URLs
- The change ensures consistency between the actual repository location and the link users see in the application
