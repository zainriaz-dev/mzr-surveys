## üõ°Ô∏è Security

We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please follow our responsible disclosure policy outlined in `SECURITY.md`. **Do not open a public issue.**

## ‚ùì FAQ / Troubleshooting

-   **Q: Why does the AI enhancement fail?**
    -   A: This is usually due to an invalid or rate-limited API key. Check your `.env.local` file and the status of your AI provider account. The app will automatically try the next provider in your `AI_PROVIDER_ORDER` list.

-   **Q: Can I use just one AI provider?**
    -   A: Yes. Simply set `AI_PROVIDER_ORDER` to a single provider (e.g., `gemini`) and fill in the corresponding environment variables.
